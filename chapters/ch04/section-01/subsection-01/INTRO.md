# 4.1.1 Core of the Evaluator

## What this subsection teaches

An interpreter dispatches on syntax, environment, and primitive operations. Distinguish user-language values from host-language code.

## Connecting the concept to Rust

Use an AST enum plus a separate evaluation function; the Rust interpreter is not literally metacircular. The translation is intended to explain computational ideas, not imitate the exact source language syntax. Think about the input, output, representation invariant, and what changes when evaluation order or mutable state enters the picture.

## Exercise

Add subtraction to an expression evaluator.

**Study method:** trace a small input on paper, run the closest example from this repository, then explain the result and resource usage. Which aspects are mathematical and which depend on the implementation?
