# 5.1.3 Subroutines

## What this subsection teaches

Shared machine instructions need calling conventions and return addresses to resume callers correctly.

## Connecting the concept to Rust

Use an instruction enum and named registers to design a small control machine. The translation is intended to explain computational ideas, not imitate the exact source language syntax. Think about the input, output, representation invariant, and what changes when evaluation order or mutable state enters the picture.

## Exercise

Trace nested subroutine calls.

**Study method:** trace a small input on paper, run the closest example from this repository, then explain the result and resource usage. Which aspects are mathematical and which depend on the implementation?
