# 5.5.7 Compiler-Evaluator Interface

## What this subsection teaches

Interpreted and compiled functions can interoperate only if they agree on value representation, environments, and calling convention.

## Connecting the concept to Rust

Use an expression enum, instruction vector, and virtual-machine stack to separate compilation from execution. The translation is intended to explain computational ideas, not imitate the exact source language syntax. Think about the input, output, representation invariant, and what changes when evaluation order or mutable state enters the picture.

## Exercise

Specify a shared function-call protocol.

**Study method:** trace a small input on paper, run the closest example from this repository, then explain the result and resource usage. Which aspects are mathematical and which depend on the implementation?
