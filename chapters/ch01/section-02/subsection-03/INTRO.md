# 1.2.3 Orders of Growth

## What this subsection teaches

Big-O classifies scaling rather than exact runtime. Analyze time and space separately, and identify the dominant resource as input grows.

## Connecting the concept to Rust

Use unit tests and loops to compare process shapes. Rust does not guarantee optimization of tail-recursive function calls. The translation is intended to explain computational ideas, not imitate the exact source language syntax. Think about the input, output, representation invariant, and what changes when evaluation order or mutable state enters the picture.

## Exercise

Predict work at n and 2n for linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and exponential algorithms.

**Study method:** trace a small input on paper, run the closest example from this repository, then explain the result and resource usage. Which aspects are mathematical and which depend on the implementation?
